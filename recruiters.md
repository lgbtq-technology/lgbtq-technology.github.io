For Recruiters
===========

Welcome!

You're welcome to recruit in this slack. However, we have a few specific requests

If someone asks you not to contact them, stop immediately. Not doing so is harassment and is not allowed by our [code of conduct](coc.md)

It'd be amazing if you actually participated in the community as a person. Generally people are much more receptive to other queer folks who participate in their space than outsiders trying merely to recruit here.

Make use of the #jobs channel and spreadsheet pinned there. People seeking jobs look there first.

Advertising unpaid internships is absolutely not permitted; if you are hiring for an intern, you must pay them a living wage.

Please be aware of biases in hiring and do your best to help counter them. Extend your reach past the easy-to-hire white, male, cisgender senior engineers.

We're glad you're here, and if you treat this community with respect, you can be making a mutually beneficial difference for both your recruitment and our community.

Thank you!
