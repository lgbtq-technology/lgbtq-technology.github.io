For Recruiters
===========

Welcome!

You're welcome to recruit in this slack. However, we have a few specific requests

If someone asks you not to contact them, stop immediately. Not doing so is harassment and is not allowed by our [code of conduct](coc.md)

It'd be amazing if you actually participated in the community as a person. Generally people are much more receptive to other queer folks who participate in their space than outsiders trying merely to recruit here.

Make use of the #jobs channel and spreadsheet pinned there. People seeking jobs look there first.

Please be aware of biases in hiring and do your best to help counter them. Extend your reach past the easy to hire white, male, cisgender senior engineers.

We're glad you're here, and if you treat this community with respect, you can be making a mutually beneficial difference for both your recruitment and our community.

Thank you!
