		<h2>Who&rsquo;s invited?</h2>
		<p>Anybody who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and those questioning whether they fit into those or any of the many other sub-genres of people who are not generally considered both &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and cis. Friends and allies: we appreciate your support, but this space is for us.</p>

		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called &ldquo;channels&rdquo;, and we have a few. There are two you&rsquo;ll be in by default:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullets">
			<li><span class="label radius">#announcements:</span> occasional announcements</li>
			<li><span class="label radius">#chat:</span> random chat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except <span class="label radius">announcements</span>, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>

		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple and uncontroversial <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
		<p><span class="label radius">TL;DR:</span> be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.</p>
		<p>If you're under 18, please let the admins know so we can keep an eye out for you.</p>
		<h2>Our Culture</h2>
		<p>We've documented <a href="/culture.html">our culture</a> as best we can.</p>
