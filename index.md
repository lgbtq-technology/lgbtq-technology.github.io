		<h1>LGBTQ in Technology</h1>
		<p>The <a href="https://lgbt.slack.com">LGBTQ in Technology Slack</a> is a space for LGBTQ people in technology to chat and support each other. We strive to keep it safe, positive, and confidential.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>How do I join?</h2>
		<p>The Slack is invitation-only, but invitations are freely granted. You can request one from any existing member or by emailing <a href="mailto:lgbtqintech@seldo.com">lgbtqintech@seldo.com</a>. If emailing, please let us know in your message how you heard about the Slack.</p>

	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>Who&rsquo;s invited?</h2>
		<p>Anybody who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and those questioning whether they fit into those or any of the many other sub-genres of people who are not generally considered both &ldquo;straight&rdquo; and cis. Friends and allies: we appreciate your support, but this space is for us.</p>

		<h2>I want to bring a friend!</h2>
		<p>Once youâ€™re in the group, just message an admin with the email address you wish to invite, like so: <code>/admin Would you invite [[friend&rsquo;s email here]]?</code></p>

		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called &ldquo;channels&rdquo;, and we have a few. There are two you&rsquo;ll be in by default:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullets">
			<li><span class="label radius">#announcements:</span> occasional announcements</li>
			<li><span class="label radius">#chat:</span> random chat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except <span class="label radius">announcements</span>, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple and uncontroversial <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
		<p><span class="label radius">TL;DR:</span> be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.</p>
		<p>If you're under 18, please let the admins know so we can keep an eye out for you.</p>
		<h2>Our Culture</h2>
		<p>We've documented <a href="/culture.html">our culture</a> as best we can.</p>
